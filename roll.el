;;; roll.el --- Rolling window manager -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: Szymon Wygna≈Ñski <sw@7willows.com>
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.3"))
;; Keywords: convenience, windows
;; URL: https://github.com/yourusername/roll.el

;;; Commentary:

;; Roll provides a horizontal scrolling window manager for Emacs that creates
;; a "rolling" view of your buffers, similar to tmux sessions or browser tabs.
;;
;; ## Key Concept
;;
;; Think of Roll as creating a horizontal strip of windows that you can scroll
;; through. Only a limited number of windows (panes) are visible at once, but
;; you can have many more panes that exist "off-screen" to the left and right.
;;
;; ## Features
;;
;; * Horizontal scrolling through multiple buffers
;; * Configurable number of visible windows (default: 3 max)
;; * Smooth navigation with keyboard shortcuts
;; * Move panes left/right to reorganize your workspace
;; * Persistent state - your panes remember their buffer and cursor position
;;
;; ## Quick Start
;;
;; 1. Enable roll-mode: M-x roll-mode
;; 2. Open new panes: M-x roll-open (or C-c C-r o)
;; 3. Navigate: Shift + arrow keys
;; 4. Move panes: Shift + Ctrl + arrow keys
;;
;; ## Default Key Bindings
;;
;; | Key Binding      | Command          | Description                    |
;; |------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
;; | S-<left>         | roll-go-left     | Move focus to left pane       |
;; | S-<right>        | roll-go-right    | Move focus to right pane      |
;; | S-C-<left>       | roll-move-left   | Move current pane left        |
;; | S-C-<right>      | roll-move-right  | Move current pane right       |
;; | C-c C-r o        | roll-open        | Create new pane               |
;; | C-c C-r r        | roll-reload      | Refresh window layout         |
;;
;; ## Configuration
;;
;; You can customize Roll's behavior with these variables:
;;
;;   (setq roll-max-visible-panes 4)     ; Show up to 4 panes at once
;;   (setq roll-debug-enabled nil)       ; Disable debug messages
;;
;; ## Example Workflow
;;
;; 1. M-x roll-mode                      ; Enable rolling window manager
;; 2. M-x roll-open                      ; Split to create second pane
;; 3. Open a file or switch buffer       ; Work in second pane
;; 4. M-x roll-open                      ; Create third pane
;; 5. S-<left> / S-<right>               ; Navigate between panes
;; 6. S-C-<left>                         ; Move current pane to the left
;;
;; ## Visual Example
;;
;; With roll-max-visible-panes set to 3, you might have:
;;
;; Hidden | Visible Panes        | Hidden
;; -------|---------------------|-------
;; [A][B] | [C] [D*] [E]        | [F][G]
;;             ^^^
;;        Currently focused pane
;;
;; * S-<right> would scroll to show: [D*] [E] [F]
;; * S-<left> would scroll to show: [B] [C] [D*]
;;
;; ## Troubleshooting
;;
;; * If panes seem "stuck", try M-x roll-reload to refresh the layout
;; * Debug messages can be enabled with (setq roll-debug-enabled t)
;; * Roll mode must be enabled before using roll commands
;;
